Bloccit was my third project modeled after Reddit. Its my first back-end project using ruby on rails. Getting ruby set up was a bit difficult since I have a windows computer but with the help of my mentor we got it running. Being my first project using ruby, it was a bit difficult to get used to coding with ruby. I kept trying to code as if I'm writing javascript and it would mess my up in the process. However, I was able to overcome that and complete this simple project.

This project didn't have to many difficulties that popped up. Ruby in my opinion is a bit easier to grasp when compared to javascript and angular, so I was able to breeze through this project without to many difficulties.

The end result was a nice clone of Reddit that functions as a forum posting website. Users are able to make posts and comment on other posts and all comments and posts are attached to a specific account.
