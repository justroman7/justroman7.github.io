Bloc jams was the first project I worked on in Bloc. Bloc jams is a music player that allows you to play music in the browser while also allowing to store multiple albums in as well. For the start of the project, I only used simple javascript, html, and css to create the website. However I then refactored it to include jQuery and angularjs to get a feel for how to create bloc jams in different ways.

This being my first project, there were some complications that arose. Coding the website in simple html, javascript and css was simple enough however when refactoring to jQuery gave me a bit of a trouble getting used to jQuery. However my biggest struggle was angularjs. Setting up controllers and working with the data binding gave me a run for my money. However, after working with my mentor and working through the assignment, I finally was able to grasp angular and how it all works.

In the end, I made a nice web music player. Angularjs gave me a lot of issues but after working through it i was able to produce the end result. This was a good first project to get me started and get a feel for how front-end development work.
