## Explanation

BlocJams is a music player that allows users to play their favorite songs. BlocJams key features are modifying the dom to get certain features like play and pause to work, while also using jquery to reduce some of the more repetitive code while also adding more features like updating seeks bars.

## Problem

The problem that I needed to solve was I needed to build a music Player from scratch that was able to hold albums of music and play the songs from those albums.

## Solution

The solution was using JavaScript and jQuery to make a simple music player that can hold the info of albums and allow you to play the music from those albums.

## Results

The result is a very nice, simple to use music player that can hold the information of the album whilst allowing you to play back the music from it. It also allows you to use the seek bars to change the position and volume of the song.

## Conclusion

Being rather new to coding and this is my first big project I did, id say the project itself came out alright. The project introduced me to many new concepts includeing Jquery and manipulating the dom. I learned quite a bit of JavaScript and jQuery that I hope to use in many different projects in the future.
