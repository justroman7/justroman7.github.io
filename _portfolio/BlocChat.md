Bloc chat was the second project I tackled during Bloc. Bloc chat is a web based chatting service that uses angularjs and firebase to allow chatting to happen in real time. This project was another simple front-end project that implemented firebase into the project to allow chatting to happen in real time.

However this project still gave me difficulties. I still haven't grasped angular fully so doing this project helped me with getting a better understanding with angular. This project went more in-depth with angular so it helped me learn the data binding and setting up controllers with angular. After getting over that hurdle and finally understanding angular, this project stopped giving me trouble and I was able to complete it.

The result was a nice, simple to use web based chatting server that includes angular and firebase. The chat happens and respond in real time and you have to make an account in order to use the chatting service.
