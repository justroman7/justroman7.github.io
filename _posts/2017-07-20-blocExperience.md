title: "My experience with Bloc"
---

My experience with Bloc right now had been pretty great. I came into Bloc with very little coding experience and I have so far learned quite a bit of basic and some advanced JavaScript. I have also dabbled a bit with angular and jQuery to get a feel for how both of those codes work and to get a basic concept of how to use them in my future projects. So far the projects haven't been to hard as of right now, with the exception of angular where I struggled for a bit but with the help of my mentor and a little bit of googling I was able to overcome the problems and finish the problems. My mentor has be able to answer any questions I have had for him and has been able to guide me in the right place when the problems got a bit to hard. All in all I would have to say my experience with Bloc has been a very positive one and I cant wait to progress farther into the curriculum to learn even more code.
