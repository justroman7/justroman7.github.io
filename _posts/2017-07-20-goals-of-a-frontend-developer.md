title: "My goals with being a web developer"
---

My goals as a web developer after bloc would be to pursue a career in the web developer field. I wish to take what I have learned and apply it to real life scenarios. I also wish to continue my learning of web development with the job I hopefully get. In the mean time of me searching for a job, I will continue to refine my coding and continue to learn with the available resources I can find so that I don't become rusty from not coding.
