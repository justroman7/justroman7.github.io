title: "My goals with being a front-end eveloper"
---

My goals with being a frontend web developer would be to finish bloc with a good portfolio to be able to snag a web-developer job ass soon as possible. Of course it will take some time to be able to get one after I'm done with the course but I hope to be able to land a job with a startup company to begin to apply all that I learned from bloc onto real world. With this job, I will hopefully be able to also expand my knowledge and continue to learn more code to help me become a better frontend developer.

If I have a hard time with landing a job in the beginning, then I will continue to code and try and fine tune my code. I will develop mock websites to also bolster my portfolio so that I don't become rusty with coding. This is my current goals of being a frontend web developer.
