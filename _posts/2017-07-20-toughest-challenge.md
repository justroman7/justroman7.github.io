title: "Toughest challenge faced"
---

One of my toughest challenges I have faced so far would be angular js. Angular for some reason gave me a really hard time. I just couldn't get a grasp on the code angular and how it worked. Especially with the controllers part, I couldn't really figure out how to get the code to work with the controller. However, with the help of my mentor we were able to overcome it. Now I have a lot better knowledge of how a controller works and no longer struggle as much there.

Another slight challenge I'm facing is just trying to remember all the code and techniques I am learning. I know this will come naturally from just using the code, but I'm trying to not forget the more important code and techniques so that I will be in a better spot for once I get an actual job.
