  I'm a junior web developer fresh from Bloc looking to expand my knowledge and skill of web development. Currently I have not chosen which I wish to specialize in as I enjoyed both the front-end and the back-end development. I now hope to get a job that will help me with applying my skills that I have learned, as well as teaching me more about web development.
