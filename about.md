I'm a junior web developer that took the online course Bloc. I've learned front-end and back-end which includes css, html, javascript, jQuery. angularjs, ruby and ruby on rails. I've also learned how to use GitHub and the command line. During my bloc course, I've done many projects which are listed on my website. I now wish to get a job in the web developer field so I can begin my career as a web developer and take what I learned and apply it to the real world.
